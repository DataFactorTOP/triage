            "text": "Running an Experiment\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo use a Triage experiment, you first need:\n\n\n\n\nPython 3.5\n\n\nA PostgreSQL database with your source data (events, geographical data, etc) loaded.\n\n\nAmple space on an available disk (or S3) to store the needed matrices and models for your experiment\n\n\nAn experiment definition (see \nDefining an Experiment\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou may run a Triage experiment two ways: through the Triage command line tool, or through instantiating an Experiment object in your own Python code and running it. The rest of this document will introduce experiment runs of increasing complexity, through both the CLI and Python interfaces.\n\n\nSimple Example\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo run an experiment, you need to tell triage at a minimum where to find the experiment file (in YAML format), and how to connect to the database, In this simple example, we're assuming that the experiment will be run with only one process, and that the matrices and models should be stored on the local filesystem.\n\n\nCLI\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Triage CLI defaults database connection information to a file stored in 'database.yaml', so with this you can omit any mention of the database. In addition, if you leave out the project path. In addition, the 'project path' (where matrices and models are stored) defaults to the current working directory. So this is the simplest possible invocation:\n\n\ntriage experiment example_experiment_config.yaml\n\n\n\n\nIf you have the database information stored somewhere else, you may pass it to the top-level 'triage' command:\n\n\ntriage -d mydbconfig.yaml experiment example_experiment_config.yaml\n\n\n\n\nAssuming you want the matrices and models stored somewhere else, pass it as the \n--project-path\n:\n\n\ntriage -d mydbconfig.yaml experiment example_experiment_config.yaml --project-path '/path/to/directory/to/save/data'\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen running an experiment in Python, the database information is passed in the form of a SQLAlchemy database engine, and the experiment information is passed as a dictionary rather as YAML specifically.\n\n\nfrom triage.experiments import SingleThreadedExperiment\n\nexperiment = SingleThreadedExperiment(\n    config=experiment_config, # a dictionary\n    db_engine=create_engine(...), # http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html\n    project_path='/path/to/directory/to/save/data'\n)\nexperiment.run()\n\n\n\n\nMulticore example\n\u00b6\n\n\nTriage also offers the ability to parallelize both CPU-heavy and database-heavy tasks. Triage uses the multiprocessing library to perform both of these, but they are separately configurable as the database tasks will more likely be bounded by the number of connections/cores available on the database server instead of the number of cores available on the experiment running machine.\n\n\nCLI\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Triage CLI allows parallelization to be specified through the \n--n-processes\n and \n--n-db-processes\n parameters.\n\n\ntriage experiment example_experiment_config.yaml --project-path '/path/to/directory/to/save/data' --n-db-processes 4 --n-processes 8\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn Python, you can use the \nMultiCoreExperiment\n instead of the \nSingleThreadedExperiment\n, and similarly pass the \nn_processes\n and \nn_db_processes\n parameters. We also recommend using \ntriage.create_engine\n. It will create a serializable version of the engine that will be fully reconstructed in multiprocess contexts. If you pass a regular SQLAlchemy engine, in these contexts the engine will be reconstructed with the \ndatabase URL only\n, which may cancel other settings you have used to configure your engine.\n\n\n\nfrom triage.experiments import MultiCoreExperiment\nfrom triage import create_engine\n\nexperiment = MultiCoreExperiment(\n    config=experiment_config, # a dictionary\n    db_engine=create_engine(...),\n    project_path='/path/to/directory/to/save/data',\n    n_db_processes=4,\n    n_processes=8,\n)\nexperiment.run()\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing S3 to store matrices and models\n\u00b6\n\n\nTriage can operate on different storage engines for matrices and models, and besides the standard filesystem engine comes with S3 support out of the box. To use this, just use the \ns3://\n scheme for your \nproject_path\n (this is similar for both Python and the CLI).\n\n\nCLI\n\u00b6\n\n\ntriage experiment example_experiment_config.yaml --project-path 's3://bucket/directory/to/save/data'\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\u00b6\n\n\nfrom triage.experiments import SingleThreadedExperiment\n\nexperiment = SingleThreadedExperiment(\n    config=experiment_config, # a dictionary\n    db_engine=create_engine(...),\n    project_path='s3://bucket/directory/to/save/data'\n)\nexperiment.run()\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating an Experiment\n\u00b6\n\n\nConfiguring an experiment is complex, and running an experiment can take a long time as data scales up. If there are any misconfigured values, it's going to help out a lot to figure out what they are before we run the Experiment. So when you have completed your experiment config and want to test it out, it's best to validate the Experiment first. If any problems are detectable in your Experiment, either in configuration or the database tables referenced by it, this method will throw an exception. For instance, if I refer to the \ncat_complaints\n table in a feature aggregation but it doesn't exist, I'll see something like this:\n\n\n*** ValueError: from_obj query does not run.\nfrom_obj: \"cat_complaints\"\nFull error: (psycopg2.ProgrammingError) relation \"cat_complaints\" does not exist\nLINE 1: explain select * from cat_complaints\n                              ^\n [SQL: 'explain select * from cat_complaints']\n\n\n\n\nCLI\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe CLI, by default, validates before running. You can tweak this behavior, and make it not validate, or make it \nonly\n validate.\n\n\ntriage experiment example_experiment_config.yaml --project-path '/path/to/directory/to/save/data' --no-validate\n\n\n\n\ntriage experiment example_experiment_config.yaml --project-path '/path/to/directory/to/save/data' --validate-only\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\u00b6\n\n\nExperiments expose a \nvalidate\n method that can be run as needed. Experiment instantiation doesn't change from the run examples at all.\n\n\nexperiment.validate()\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the \nvalidate\n method will stop as soon as it encounters an error ('strict' mode). If you would like it to validate each section without stopping (i.e. if you have only written part of the experiment configuration), call \nvalidate(strict=False)\n and all of the errors will be changed to warnings.\n\n\nWe'd like to add more validations for common misconfiguration problems over time. If you got an unexpected error that turned out to be related to a confusing configuration value, help us out by adding to the \nvalidation module\n and submitting a pull request!\n\n\nRestarting an Experiment\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf an experiment fails for any reason, you can restart it. Each matrix and each model file is saved with a filename matching a hash of its unique attributes, so when the experiment is rerun, it will by default reuse the matrix or model instead of rebuilding it. If you would like to change this behavior and replace existing versions of matrices and models, set the 'replace' flag. \n\n\nCLI\n\u00b6\n\n\ntriage experiment example_experiment_config.yaml --project-path '/path/to/directory/to/save/data' --replace\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\u00b6\n\n\nfrom triage.experiments import SingleThreadedExperiment\n\nexperiment = SingleThreadedExperiment(\n    config=experiment_config, # a dictionary\n    db_engine=create_engine(...),\n    project_path='s3://bucket/directory/to/save/data',\n    replace=True\n)\nexperiment.run()\n\n\n\n\nRunning parts of an Experiment\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you would like incrementally build, or just incrementally run parts of the Experiment look at their outputs, you can do so. Running a full experiment requires the \nexperiment config\n to be filled out, but when you're getting started using Triage it can be easier to build the experiment piece by piece and see the results as they come in. Make sure logging is set to INFO level before running this to ensure you get all the log messages.\n\n\nRunning parts of an experiment is only supported through the Python interface.\n\n\nPython\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.run()\n will run until it no longer has enough configuration to proceed. You will see information in the logs telling you about the steps it was able to perform. If you initialize the Experiment with \ncleanup=False\n, you can view the intermediate tables that are built. They are modified with the experiment hash that the experiment calculates, but this will be printed out in the log messages.\n\n\n\n\nlabels_*<experiment_hash>*\n for the labels generated per entity and as of date.\n\n\ntmp_sparse_states_*<experiment_hash>*\n for the membership in each cohort per entity and as_of_date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reproduce the entire Experiment piece by piece, you can run the following. Each one of these methods requires some portion of \nexperiment config\n to be passed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.split_definitions\n will parse temporal config and create time splits. It only requires \ntemporal_config\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.generate_cohort()\n will use the cohort config and as of dates from the temporal config to generate an internal table keeping track of what entities are in the cohort on different dates. It requires \ntemporal_config\n and \ncohort_config\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.generate_labels()\n will use the label config and as of dates from the temporal config to generate an internal labels table. It requires \ntemporal_config\n and \nlabel_config\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.generate_preimputation_features()\n will use the feature aggregation config and as of dates from the temporal config to generate internal features tables. It requires \ntemporal_config\n and \nfeature_aggregations\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.generate_imputed_features()\n will use the imputation sections of the feature aggregation config and the results from the preimputed features to create internal imputed features tables. It requires \ntemporal_config\n and \nfeature_aggregations\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.build_matrices()\n will use all of the internal tables generated before this point, along with feature grouping config, to generate all needed matrices.

Look at these to see how classifiers perform over different training windows.\n\n\nmodel_metadata.matrices - Each matrix that was used for training and testing has metadata written about it such as the matrix hash, length, and time configuration.\n\n\ntrain_results.feature_importances - The sklearn feature importances results for each trained model\n\n\ntrain_results.predictions - Prediction probabilities for train matrix entities generated against trained models\n\n\ntrain_results.evaluations - Metric scores of trained models on the training data.\n\n\ntest_results.predictions - Prediction probabilities for test matrix entities generated against trained models\n\n\ntest_results.evaluations - Metric scores of trained models over given testing windows\n\n\ntest_results.individual_importances - Individual feature importance scores for test matrix entities.\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example query, which returns the top 10 model groups by precision at the top 100 entities:\n\n\n    select\n        model_groups.model_group_id,\n        model_groups.model_type,\n        model_groups.hyperparameters,\n        max(test_evaluations.value) as max_precision\n    from model_metadata.model_groups\n        join model_metadata.models using (model_group_id)\n        join test_results.evaluations using (model_id)\n    where\n        metric = 'precision@'\n        and parameter = '100_abs'\n    group by 1,2,3\n    order by 4 desc\n    limit 10\n\n\n\n\nInspecting an Experiment before running\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore you run an experiment, you can inspect properties of the Experiment object to ensure that it is configured in the way you want. Some examples:\n\n\n\n\nexperiment.all_as_of_times\n for debugging temporal config. This will show all dates that features and labels will be calculated at.\n\n\nexperiment.feature_dicts\n will output a list of feature dictionaries, representing the feature tables and columns configured in this experiment\n\n\nexperiment.matrix_build_tasks\n will output a list representing each matrix that will be built.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Classes\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nSingleThreadedExperiment\n: An experiment that performs all tasks serially in a single thread. Good for simple use on small datasets, or for understanding the general flow of data through a pipeline.\n\n\nMultiCoreExperiment\n: An experiment that makes use of the multiprocessing library to parallelize various time-consuming steps. Takes an \nn_processes\n keyword argument to control how many workers to use.\n\n\nRQExperiment\n: An experiment that makes use of the python-rq library to enqueue individual tasks onto the default queue, and wait for the jobs to be finished before moving on. python-rq requires Redis and any number of worker processes running the Triage codebase. Triage does not set up any of this needed infrastructure for you. Available through the RQ extra ( \npip install triage[rq]\n )",

A query, provided by the user in the configuration file, that generates entity_ids and outcomes for a given\nas_of_date and label_timespan.\n\n\n\n\nEach as_of_date and label_timespan defined in temporal config\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, an inspections-style query (for the given timespan, return the entity and outcome of any matching\ninspections) would look like:\n\n\n    select\n    events.entity_id,\n    bool_or(outcome::bool)::integer as outcome\n    from events\n    where '{as_of_date}' <= outcome_date\n        and outcome_date < '{as_of_date}'::timestamp + interval '{label_timespan}'\n        group by entity_id\n\n\n\n\nThis binary labels table is scoped to the entire Experiment, so all \nas_of_time\n (computed in step 1) and\n\nlabel_timespan\n (taken straight from \ntemporal_config\n) combinations are present. Additionally, the 'label_name' and\n'label_type' are also recorded with each row in the table.\n\n\nAt this point, the 'labels' table may not have entries for all entities and dates that need to be in a given matrix.\nHow these rows have their labels represented is up to the configured \ninclude_missing_labels_in_train_as\n value in the\nexperiment. This value is not processed when we generate the labels table, but later on when the matrix is built (see\n'Retrieving Data and Saving Completed Matrix')\n\n\nState Table\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Experiment keeps track of the state of the entities. Based on the configuration, certain entities can be included\nor excluded for different time periods in feature imputation, creating matrices, or both.\n\n\nIn code, it does this by computing what it calls the 'sparse' state table for an experiment. This is a table with a\nboolean flag entry for every entity, as_of_time, and state. The structure of this table allows for state filtering\nbased on SQL conditions given by the user.\n\n\nBased on configuration, it can be created through one of three code paths:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user passes what we call a 'dense states' table, with the following structure: entity id/state/start/end, and\na list of state filters, this 'dense states' table holds time ranges that entities were in for specific states.\nWhen converting this to a sparse table, we take each as_of_time present in the Experiment, and for each known state\n(that is, the distinct values found in the 'dense states' table), see if there is any entry in the dense states table\nwith this state whose range overlaps with the as_of_time. If so, the entity is considered to be in that state as of that\ndate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user passes what we call an 'entities' table, containing an entity_id, it will simply use all distinct\nentities present in said table, and mark them as 'active' for every as_of_time in the experiment. Any other columns are\nignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user passes a query, parameterized with an as of date, we will populate the table by running it for each\nas_of_date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table is created and exists until matrices are built, at which point it is considered unnecessary and then dropped.\n\n\nFeatures\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach provided \nfeature_aggregation\n configures the creation and population of several feature tables in the 'features'\nschema: one for each of the groups specified in the config, one that merges the groups together into one table, and one\nthat fills in null values from the merged table with imputed values based on imputation config.\n\n\nGenerating Aggregation SQL\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo generate the SQL that creates the pre-imputation table, the Experiment assembles building blocks from the feature\naggregation config, as well as the experiment's list of \nas_of_times\n:\n\n\n\n\nfrom_obj\n represents, well, the object of the FROM clause in the SQL query. Often this is just a table, but can be\nconfigured to be a subquery. This holds all the data that we want to aggregate into features\n\n\nEach \nas_of_time\n in the experiment and \ninterval\n in the \nfeature_aggregation\n is combined with the\n\nknowledge_date_column\n to create a WHERE clause representing a valid window of events to aggregate in the \nfrom_obj\n:\ne.g (\nwhere {knowledge_date_column} >= {as_of_time} - interval {interval}\n)\n\n\nEach \naggregate\n, \ncategorical\n, or \narray_categorical\n represents a SELECT clause. For aggregates, the \nquantity\n is\na column or SQL expression representing a numeric quantity present in the \nfrom_obj\n, and the \nmetrics\n are any number\nof aggregate functions we want to use. The aggregate function is applied to the quantity.\n\n\nEach \ngroup\n is a column applied to the GROUP BY clause. Generally this is 'entity_id', but higher-level groupings\n(for instance, 'zip_code') can be used as long as they can be rolled up to 'entity_id'.\n\n\n\n\nSo a simplified version of a typical query would look like:\n\n\nSELECT {group}, {metric}({quantity})\nFROM {from_obj}\nWHERE {knowledge_date_column} >= {as_of_time} - interval {interval}\nGROUP BY {group}\n\n\n\n\nWriting Group-wide Feature Tables\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor each \nas_of_time\n, the results from the generated query are written to a table whose name is prefixed with the\n\nprefix\n, and suffixed with the \ngroup\n. For instance, if the configuration specifies zipcode-level aggregates and\nentity-level aggregates, there will be a table for each, keyed on its group plus the as_of_date.\n\n\nMerging into Aggregation-wide Feature Tables\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach generated group table is combined into one representing the whole aggregation with a left join. Given that the\ngroups originally came from the same table (the \nfrom_obj\n of the aggregation) and therefore we know the zipcode for\neach entity, what we do now is create a table that would be keyed on entity and as_of_date, and contain all\nentity-level and zipcode-level aggregates from both tables. This aggregation-level table represents all of the features\nin the aggregation, pre-imputation. Its output location is generally \n{prefix}_aggregation\n\n\nImputing Values\n\u00b6\n\n\nA table that looks similar, but with imputed values is created. The state table from above is passed into collate as\nthe comprehensive set of entities and dates for which output should be generated, regardless if they exist in the\n\nfrom_obj\n. Each feature column has an imputation rule, inherited from some level of the feature definition. The\nimputation rules that are based on data (e.g. \nmean\n) use the rows from the \nas_of_time\n to produce the imputed value.\nIts output location is generally \n{prefix}_aggregation_imputed\n\n\nRecap\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, we have at least three tables that are used to populate matrices:\n\n\n\n\nlabels\n with computed labels\n\n\ntmp_states_{experiment hash}\n that tracks what \nas_of_times\n each entity was in each state.\n\n\nA \nfeatures.{prefix}_aggregation_imputed\n table for each feature aggregation present in the experiment config.\n\n\n\n\n3. Building Matrices\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, we have to build actual train and test matrices that can be processed by machine learning algorithms, save at the user's specified path, either on the local filesystem or s3 depending on the scheme portion of the path (e.g. \ns3://bucket-name/project_directory\n)\n\n\nFirst we have to figure out exactly what matrices we have to build. The split definitions from step 1 are a\ngood start -- they are our train and test splits -- but sometimes we also want to test different subsets of the data,\nlike feature groups (e.g. 'how does using group of features A perform against using all features?'). So there's a layer\nof iteration we introduce for each split, that may produce many more matrices.\n\n\nWhat do we iterate over?\n\n Feature List - All subsets of features that the user wants to cycle through. This is the end result of the feature\ngroup generation and mixing process, which is described more below.\n\n States - All configured \nstate_filters\n in the experiment config. These take the form of boolean SQL clauses that are\napplied to the sparse states table, and the purpose of this is to test different cohorts against each other. Generally\nthere is just one here.\n\n Label names - In theory we can take in different labels (e.g. complaints, sustained complaints) in the same\nexperiment. Right now there is no support for multiple label names, but the label name used is configurable through the\noptional 'label_config'->'name' config value\n\n Label types - In theory we can take in different label types (e.g. binary) in the same experiment. \nRight now this\nisn't done, there is one label type and it is hardcoded as 'binary'.\n\n\nFeature Lists\n\u00b6\n\n\nHow do we arrive at the feature lists? There are two pieces of config that are used: \nfeature group_definition\n and\n\nfeature_group_strategies\n. Feature group definitions are just ways to define logical blocks of features, most often\nfeatures that come from the same source, or describing a particular type of event. These groups within the experiment\nas a list of feature names, representing some subset of all potential features for the experiment. Feature group\nstrategies are ways to take feature groups and mix them together in various ways. The feature group strategies take\nthese subsets of features and convert them into another list of subsets of features, which is the final list iterated\nover to create different matrices.\n\n\nFeature Group Definition\n\u00b6\n\n\nFeature groups, at present, can be defined as either a \nprefix\n (the prefix of the feature name), a \ntable\n (the\nfeature table that the feature resides in), or \nall\n (all features).  Each argument is passed as a list, and each entry\nin the list is interpreted as a group. So, a feature group config of \n{'table': ['complaints_aggregate_imputed',\n'incidents_aggregate_imputed']}\n would result in two feature groups: one with all the features in\n\ncomplaints_aggregate_imputed\n, and one with all the features in \nincidents_aggregate_imputed\n. Note that this requires\na bit of knowledge on the user's part of how the feature table names will be constructed.\n\n\nprefix\n works on the prefix of the feature name as it exists in the database. So this also requires some knowledge of\nhow these get created. The general format is: \n{aggregation_prefix}_{group}_{timeperiod}_{quantity}\n, so with some\nknowledge the user can create groups with the aggregation's configured prefix (common), or the aggregations configured\nprefix + group (in case they want to compare, for instance, zip-code level features versus entity level features).\n\n\nall\n, with a single value of \nTrue\n, will include a feature group with all defined features. If no feature group\ndefinition is sent, this is the default.\n\n\nEither way, at the end of this process the experiment will be aware of some list of feature groups, even if the list is\njust length 1 with all features as one group.\n\n\nFeature Group Mixing\n\u00b6\n\n\nA few basic feature group mixing strategies are implemented: \nleave-one-in\n, \nleave-one-out\n, and \nall\n. These are sent\nin the experiment definition as a list, so different strategies can be tried in the same experiment. Each included\nstrategy will be applied to the list of feature groups from the previous step, to convert them into\n\n\nFor instance, 'leave-one-in' will cycle through each feature group, and for each one create a list of features that\njust represents that feature group, so for some matrices we would only use features from that particular group.\n\nleave-one-out\n does the opposite, for each feature group creating a list of features that includes all other feature\ngroups but that one. \nall\n just creates a list of features that represents all feature groups together.\n\n\nIteration and Matrix Creation\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, matrices are created by looping through all train/test splits and data subsets (e.g. feature groups,\nstate definitions), grabbing the data corresponding to each from the database, and assembling that data into a design\nmatrix that is saved along with the metadata that defines it.\n\n\nAs an example, if the experiment defines 3 train/test splits (one test per train in this example, for simplicity), 3\nfeature groups that are mixed using the 'leave-one-out' and 'all' strategies, and 1 state definition, we'll expect 18\nmatrices to be saved: 9 splits after multiplying the time splits by the feature groups, and each one creating a train\nand test matrix.\n\n\nRetrieving Data and Saving Completed Matrix\n\u00b6\n\n\nHow do we get the data for an individual matrix out of the database?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an entity-date table for this specific matrix. There is some logic applied to decide what rows show up. There\nare two possible sets of rows that could show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall valid entity dates\n. These dates come from the entity-date-state table for the experiment (populated using the\nrules defined in the 'cohort_config'), filtered down to the entity-date pairs that match both \nthe state filter and the\nlist of as-of-dates for this matrix\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall labeled entity dates\n. These dates consist of all the valid entity dates from above, that also have an entry in\nthe labels table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the matrix is a test matrix, all valid entity dates will be present.\n\n\nIf the matrix is a train matrix, whether or not valid but unlabeled examples show up is decided by the\n\ninclude_missing_labels_in_train_as\n configuration value. If it is present in any form, these labels will be in the\nmatrix. Otherwise, they will be filtered out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite features data from tables to disk in CSV format using a COPY command, table by table. Each table is joined\nwith the matrix-specific entity-date table to only include the desired rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite labels data to disk in CSV format using a COPY command. These labels will consist of the rows in the\nmatrix-specific entity-date table left joined to the labels table. Rows not present in the labels table will have their\nlabel filled in (either True or False) based on the value of the \ninclude_missing_labels_in_train_as\n configuration key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge the features and labels CSV files horizontally, in pandas. They are expected to be of the same shape, which is\nenforced by the entity-date table. The resulting matrix is indexed on \nentity_id\n and \nas_of_date\n, and then saved to\ndisk (in CSV format, more formats to come) along with its metadata: time, feature, label, index, and state information.\nalong with any user metadata the experiment config specified. The filename is decided by a hash of this metadata, and\nthe metadata is saved in a YAML file with the same hash and directory. The metadata is additionally added to a database table 'matrices'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix metadata reference:\n- \nTrain matrix temporal info\n\n- \nTest matrix temporal info\n\n- \nFeature, label, index, cohort, user\nmetadata\n\n\nRecap\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, all finished matrices and metadata will be saved under the \nproject_path\n supplied by the user to the\nExperiment constructor, in the subdirectory \nmatrices\n.\n\n\n4. Running Models\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe last phase of an Experiment run uses the completed design matrices to train, test, and evaluate classifiers. This procedure writes a lot of metadata to the 3 schemas: 'model_metadata', 'train_results', and 'test_results'.\n\n\nTrain\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach matrix marked for training is sent through the configured grid in the experiment's \ngrid_config\n. This works much\nlike the scikit-learn \nParameterGrid\n (and in fact uses it on the backend). It cycles through all of the classifiers\nand hyperparameter combinations contained herein, and calls \n.fit()\n with that train matrix. Any classifier that\nadheres to the scikit-learn \n.fit/.transform\n interface and is available in the Python environment will work here,\nwhether it is a standard scikit-learn classifier, a third-party library like XGBoost, or a custom-built one in the\ncalling repository (for instance, one that implements the problem domain's baseline heuristic algorithm for\ncomparison).  Metadata about the trained classifier is written to the \nmodel_metadata.models\n Postgres table. The trained model is saved to a filename with the model hash (see Model Hash section below).\n\n\nModel Groups\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach model is assigned a 'model group'. A model group represents a number of trained classifiers that we want to treat\nas equivalent by some criteria. By default, this is aimed at defining models which are equivalent across time splits,\nto make analyzing model stability easier. This default is accomplished with a set of 'model group keys' that includes\ndata about the classifier (module, hyperparameters), temporal intervals used to create the train matrix (label\ntimespan, training history, as-of-date frequency), and metadata describing the data in the train matrix (features and\nfeature groups, label name, cohort name). The user can override this set of \nmodel_group_keys\n in the experiment\ndefinition, with all of the default information plus other matrix metadata at their disposal (See end of 'Retrieving\nData and Saving Completed Matrix' section for more about matrix metadata). This data is stored in the \nmodel_metadata.model_groups\n table, along with a \nmodel_group_id\n that is used as a foreign key in the \nmodel_metadata.models\n table.\n\n\nModel Hash\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach trained model is assigned a hash, for the purpose of uniquely defining and caching the model. This hash is based\non the training matrix metadata, classifier path, hyperparameters (except those which concern execution and do not\naffect results of the classifier, such as \nn_jobs\n), and the given project path for the Experiment. This hash can be\nfound in each row of the \nmodel_metadata.models\n table. It is enforced as a unique key in the table.\n\n\nGlobal Feature Importance\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe training phase also writes global feature importances to the database, in the \ntrain_results.feature_importances\n table.\nA few methods are queried to attempt to compute feature importances:\n\n The bulk of these are computed using the trained model's \n.feature_importances_\n attribute, if it exists.\n\n For sklearn's \nSVC\n models with a linear kernel, the model's \n.coef_.squeeze()\n is used.\n\n For sklearn's LogisticRegression models, \nnp.exp(model.coef_).squeeze()\n is used.\n\n Otherwise, no feature importances are written.\n\n\nTest Matrix\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor each test matrix, predictions, individual importances, and the user-specified testing evaluation metrics are written to the 'test_results' schema. For each train matrix, predictions and the user-specified training evaluation metrics are written to the 'train_results' schema.\n\n\nPredictions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe trained model's prediction probabilities (\npredict_proba()\n) are computed both for the matrix it was trained on and any testing matrices. The predictions for the training matrix are saved in \ntrain_results.predictions\n and those for the testing matrices are saved in the \ntest_results.predictions\n. More specifically, \npredict_proba\n returns the probabilities for each label (false and true), but in this case only the probabilities for the true label are saved in the \n{train or test}_predictions\n table. The \nentity_id\n and \nas_of_date\n are retrieved from the matrix's index, and stored in the database table along with the probability score, label value (if it has one), as well as other metadata.\n\n\nIndividual Feature Importance\n\u00b6\n\n\nFeature importances (of a configurable number of top features, defaulting to 5) for each prediction are computed and written to the \ntest_results.individual_importances\n table. Right now, there are no sophisticated calculation methods integrated into the experiment; simply the top 5 global feature importances for the model are copied to the \nindividual_importances\n table.\n\n\nMetrics\n\u00b6\n\n\nTriage allows for the computation of both testing set and training set evaluation metrics. Evaluation metrics, such as precision and recall at various thresholds, are written to either the \ntrain_results.evaluations\n table or the \ntest_results.evaluations\n. Triage defines a number of \nEvaluation Metrics\n metrics that can be addressed by name in the experiment definition, along with a list of thresholds and/or other parameters (such as the 'beta' value for fbeta) to iterate through. Thresholding is done either via absolute value (top k) or percentile by sorting the predictions and labels by the row's predicted probability score, with ties broken at random (the random seed can be passed in the config file to make this deterministic), and assigning the predicted value as True for those above the threshold. Note that the percentile thresholds are in terms of the population percentage, not a cutoff threshold for the predicted probability.\n\n\nSometimes test matrices may not have labels for every row, so it's worth mentioning here how that is handled and interacts with thresholding. Rows with missing labels are not considered in the metric calculations, and if some of these rows are in the top k of the test matrix, no more rows are taken from the rest of the list for consideration. So if the experiment is calculating precision at the top 100 rows, and 40 of the top 100 rows are missing a label, the precision will actually be calculated on the 60 of the top 100 rows that do have a label. To make the results of this more transparent for users, a few extra pieces of metadata are written to the evaluations table for each metric score.\n\n\n\n\nnum_labeled_examples\n - The number of rows in the test matrix that have labels\n\n\nnum_labeled_above_threshold\n - The number of rows above the configured threshold for this metric score that have\nlabels\n\n\nnum_positive_labels\n - The number of positive labels in the test matrix\n\n\n\n\nRecap\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, the 'model_metadata', 'train_results', and 'test_results' database schemas are fully populated with data about models, model groups, predictions, feature importances, and evaluation metrics for the researcher to query. In addition, the trained model pickle files are saved in the configured project path. The experiment is considered finished.",

Thresholding is done either via absolute value (top k) or percentile by sorting the predictions and labels by the row's predicted probability score, with ties broken at random (the random seed can be passed in the config file to make this deterministic), and assigning the predicted value as True for those above the threshold. Note that the percentile thresholds are in terms of the population percentage, not a cutoff threshold for the predicted probability.  Sometimes test matrices may not have labels for every row, so it's worth mentioning here how that is handled and interacts with thresholding. Rows with missing labels are not considered in the metric calculations, and if some of these rows are in the top k of the test matrix, no more rows are taken from the rest of the list for consideration.
