# Feature Importance Scores for Individual Predictions

This module calculates feature importance scores for individual predictions generated by selected model groups. 
This is meant to be used as a postmodeling tool, i.e. once the model groups are narrowed down using Audition. 


### Inputs to the module

The user will provide the following to the module:
- The experiment hash
- model groups interested in
- where the models and matrices are stored (project path)
- explainers to be used
- thresholds. Can use many or one of the following
  - top k percentile
  - top k absolute
  - bottom k percentile
  - bottom k absolute
  - score range (a list)
- (optional) the train end time ranges the user is interested in


### The outputs from the module

The results generated by the module are stored in the test_results schema. 

Current table structure: 
- model_id,
- entity_id,
- as_of_date
- feature
- method
- importance_score
- feature_value


Proposed table:
- entity_id 
- as_of_date
- model_id
- explainer_method (The explanation method name)
- explainer_hyperparameters (Json)
- feature_name
- feature_value
- importance_score
- feature_rank






### Adding a new explainer to the Module

Have an abstract base class that can be implemented by a new method. 
SHould implement `explain_instance()` and `explain_dataset()` methods ...
